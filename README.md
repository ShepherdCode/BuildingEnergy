# Time Series Analysis of Building Energy Data
by Aida da Silva and Jason Rafe Miller.
This was a student collaboration for WVU CS 677 with Professor Dehzangi.


## Getting started
* Create a directory called BuildingEnergy.
* Populate BuildingEnergy with all the Python notebook files (*.ipynb).
* Create a subdirectory called data and move to that directory.
* Download [archive.zip](https://www.kaggle.com/claytonmiller/buildingdatagenomeproject2/download) 
from Kaggle into the data subdirectory.
* Rename archive.zip to BuildingData.zip (but do not unzip it).
* Move up to the BuildingEnergy directory.
* Start Jupyter notebook.
* Run the weather notebook as your first test.

## Notebooks from Presentation 1
* Note each notebook (ipynb) has a corresponding Python script generated by nbconvert and saved in the scripts subdirctory.
All notebooks used our BuildingSet1 data subset: 16 buildings with fairly complete steam usage data from site Eagle.
* **Report1.Weather.ipynb** finds that air temp is highly correlated to energy usage.
* **Report1.Identity_101.ipynb** uses a naive model.
* **Report1.LinReg_101.ipynb** uses linear regression.
* **Report1.RNN_107.ipynb** (formerly named LSTM_107) uses a SimpleRNN neural net.
* **Report1.LSTM_108.ipynb** uses an LSTM neural net.
* **Report1.CNN_107.ipynb** uses a CNN neural net.

## Notebooks from Presentation 2
* **ConvLSTM.ipynb** 

## Data sources
* Publication [Scientific Data](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-00712-x)
* Kaggle [project page](https://www.kaggle.com/claytonmiller/buildingdatagenomeproject2)
* Download [archive.zip](https://www.kaggle.com/claytonmiller/buildingdatagenomeproject2/download) from Kaggle

## LSTnet
* Paper on [ACM](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3209978.3210006)
or [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07015) or [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.07015.pdf)
* LSTNet authors posted their Python 2 and PyTorch [code](https://github.com/laiguokun/LSTNet)
* A 3rd party Python 3 and Keras implementation [here](https://github.com/fbadine/LSTNet) and [another](https://github.com/Lorne0/LSTNet_keras) that claims to be faster.
