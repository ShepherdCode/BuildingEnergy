# Building Energy Data
A student collaboration for WVU.

## Source for the Dataset

* Publication https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-00712-x
* Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/claytonmiller/buildingdatagenomeproject2
* Download https://www.kaggle.com/claytonmiller/buildingdatagenomeproject2/download

## Getting started
* Create a directory called BuildingEnergy.
* Populate BuildingEnergy with all the Python notebook files (*.ipynb).
* Create a subdirectory called data and move to that directory.
* Download [archive.zip](https://www.kaggle.com/claytonmiller/buildingdatagenomeproject2/download) 
from Kaggle into the data subdirectory.
* Rename archive.zip to BuildingData.zip (but do not unzip it).
* Move up to the BuildingEnergy directory.
* Start Jupyter notebook.
* Run the weather notebook as your first test.
